### Personal background

I was born and raised in [Tianjin](https://goo.gl/maps/Z9mNuf78ABCCQwfu6), China, and my name in Chinese characters is 黄诗萌. In September 2012, I moved to Beijing to start my undergraduate study in Economics at [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.njtu.edu.cn/). In July 2014, I continued my degree at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), Canada. After spending some enjoyable years there and in the Greater Toronto Area (specifically Mississauga and Toronto) for study and work, I decided to move to Copenhagen, Denmark, to pursue my PhD degree in September 2021.
