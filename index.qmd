Hi, my name is Shimeng. I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the [Institute of Science
and Technology Austria](https://ista.ac.at/en/home/) (ISTA) working with
[Francesco Locatello](https://www.francescolocatello.com) (Causal Learning and
Artificial Intelligence, CLAI) and [Matthew
Robinson](https://research-explorer.ista.ac.at/person/E5D42276-F5DA-11E9-8E24-6303E6697425)
(Medical Genomics). I obtained my PhD in Statistics from the [University of
Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/en) under the supervision of [Niklas
Pfister](https://niklaspfister.github.io) and [Jonas
Peters](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jopeters/) where I was a member of the
[Copenhagen Causality Lab](https://cocala.github.io/) (CoCaLa).
