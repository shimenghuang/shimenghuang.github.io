Hi, my name is Shimeng Huang. I'm currently a PhD candidate in Statistics 
at the University of Copenhagen under the supervision of [Niklas Pfister](niklaspfister.github.io) and [Jonas Peters](http://web.math.ku.dk/~peters/). I'm a member of the [Copenhagen Causality Lab](https://cocala.github.io/) (CoCaLa).
